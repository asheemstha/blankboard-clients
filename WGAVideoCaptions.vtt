00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.039
 Yeah, gender and my sexuality have just never been good things. Right outside the gate they were

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.640
 problems and problematic and everybody else felt like they were a problem and I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.339
 was a problem or I'm a mistake is kind of how I felt. I really struggled with

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:37.759
 gender identity issues at a really early age around four or five years old. So

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:47.000
 navigating like big questions about identity and behavior, sexual behavior, alone really for the most part.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 You're not designed to do it alone. That's why it's so hard. The more you're trying to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:08.879
 do it by yourself, the more you're working against the very way God created you to be. We're created to be together. We're created to be in relationship with one another.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.840
 I was struggling with a lot of addiction. I was estranged from my family and that was one of the

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:30.000
 things that where Grace Abounds helped was helped me to get back in relationship with my family and start doing that real hard work of forgiveness and dealing

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.180
 with my addictions that I had picked up. It was a space to talk about those things.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:47.599
 When I came to Where Grace Abounds, what I did not expect to find was a family. And you know I have family that I love dearly, biological family, and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.480
 but I didn't expect to find a space where I belonged and I could show up to the table with

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.359
 my whole self. In the gay community I could find a lot of acceptance for my sexuality but my faith

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.459
 was kind of like I don't know what to do with that.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.300
 At church, I could talk about God all day long, but, you know,

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.259
 sexuality questions were really felt off-limits.

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:18.319
 So showing up somewhere where I could bring all of that to the table was really,

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:20.580
 I realized, like, I want to be part of this.

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:27.180
 For people who are dealing with sexual and gender relational issues, what I want them

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:35.919
 to know first is that they are not some anomaly.

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.919
 I don't care how much it's in the news.

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:45.000
 I don't care how often it's used as an example of the worst kind of sin.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 They are no different than any other person on this earth,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 that we're all in the same boat.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 And I want them to know that because

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 the idea that they are set apart somehow and worse than

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 is part of the problem.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.719
 It keeps you from even starting to think through and reach out for help.

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:27.280
 The secret of the spiritual life is continually beginning again. And I think that embodies grace.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.219
 Rather than, you messed up again, it's like, welcome back.

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:35.780
 Welcome back.

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.219
 Welcome back to the God who loves you.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.580
 Welcome back to the community that we're in this together.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.240
 People are really surprised that we're not just a group of people

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.900
 sitting around being sad all the time.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.460
 There's space for sadness,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.199
 and we welcome that,

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.219
 but it's also okay to be happy

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:56.599
 and to experience joy.

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.259
 He didn't create us to be on our own.

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.900
 He created us to be in relationship

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.199
 with one another and to be in community.

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:10.560
 To be together while we're feeding the hungry and visiting people in prison and

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.819
 to have a purposeful relationship ongoing with people.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:27.779
 We have people who have come from Hawaii, Alaska, California, Washington, Missouri, New York, Florida.

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:34.019
 So it's exciting to just be able to offer our community in a broader way.

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:38.439
 If I didn't have any responsibility, if I wasn't teaching, if I wasn't on staff at

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:47.000
 Word Race Abounds, if I wasn't leading a small group that night, I would still want to come weekly

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 because it's the best thing I do for myself.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 I think there's not only hope for what's to come, but there's hope right now

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:21.139
 that I'm not left alone in the darkness by myself. Well, I had a therapist say,

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.860
 I don't understand how you do truth and grace around these topics.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.699
 And I said, come and see.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.620
 Come on a Thursday.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.879
 Come and join us.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.779
 There is room for you in God's kingdom.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:49.040
 There is room for your child in God's kingdom. and there is a space where you can explore all of these things and still uphold god's truth

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.879
 god's grace 100 no compromise
